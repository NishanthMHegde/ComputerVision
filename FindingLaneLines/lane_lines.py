Steps to find lane lines:

1. Read the image 
2. Convert the image into grayscale so that it becomes easy for edge detection. Grayscale converts an RGB image to a
black and white sort of image where the image array consists of pixel intensities
ranging from 0 to 255. 0 is completely black (no intensity) and 255 is completely white. 

Important terms:
Edge: Edge is the drastic change in intensity of adjacent pixel values. For example, if a black image pixel 
suddenly changes into a white image pixel in the adjacent column or row, then we call it an edge.
Gradient: Measure of change of pixel intensity for adjacent pixels.
Stong gradient: Very high change in pixel intensity. Example: from 0 to 255.
Small gradient: Very low change in pixel intensity. Example: from 0 to 20.
To measure the gradient we find the derivative(f(x,y)), where
f(x,y) = Function that compares the intensity values of pixels horizontally (x) and vertically(y).
derivative(f(x,y)) = Measure of rate of change of pixel intensities horizontally and vertically.

3. Apply Gaussian blur in order to smoothen the image and remove the possibilty of finding
false edges in the images. For smoothening, we select a grid of some size (preferably (5,5)).
We traverse the image using this grid and calculate the average value in the grid and 
construct another image array which will be the blurred image. 
4. Apply Canny edge detection to detect the edges in the images. 
For canny edge detection, we decide upon the low and high thresholds for pixel intensities.
Any pixel with intensity more than high threshold is accepted and any pixel with intensity
less than low_threshold is rejected. If a pixel falls in between the low and high thresholds
then it will be selected if it is a main Edge. 
5. Display the image.

Line detection using Hough Transform:
Every line can be represented in the form of y = mx + b in cartesian coordinates.
A point (x,y) can have infinite possible values for m and b since infinite number of lines
(family of lines) can pass through the point (x,y)

Hough Space is represented by a 2D plane with slope m as the X-axis and intercept b as Y-axis 
in the form of a line connecting m and b. 
If there are 2 points in a cartesian plane such that a line can be drawn through them, then it means
that in the Hough Space, their corresponding lines meet at a point.
Consider multiple points on a cartesian plane, if a line can be drawn through the points, it means that
in the Hough space there will be a point of intersection for some value of (m,b). 
When one line cannot be drawn through all the points, then we draw a grid in the hough space and select the 
cell where maximum number of lines in Hough Space intersect each other. We then draw a line through those points
only in the cartesian plane.

We need to use polar cordinates because perpendicular lines cannot be drawn in cartesian plane.

In polar coordinates,
P = xcos@ + ysin@
where @ is the angle made by the line with x-axis. 

Hough space consists of P on the y-axis and @ on x-axis. It has sinosodial wave forms and the point
(@,P) where the waves intersect is the value which will give a line through the points.
